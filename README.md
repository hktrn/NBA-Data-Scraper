# NBA-Data-Scraper

This is a Web scraper that collects NBA data including regular season player statistics, statistics leaders, and award winners

## Packages

You will need BeautifulSoup(bs4) and pandas 
```python
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

## How to use
I made 2 functions to collect 1 year data or collect multiple year data. Put in the year you want in the parameters and run the code
```python
get_data(start, end)
get_data_1year(year)

 ```
 
 ## Plans for this program/data
 
1. I will try to implement more data to my program such as collecting specific teams data, playoff player statistics, draft picks, etc. in the near future.
2. I want to learn more about data science & machine learning and will be using this data for my learning.
 
 
## Couple of words from me
Thank you for your time for viewing my project, this was my first project and introduction to Web Scraping in Python. I really enjoyed it as I learned a lot about HTML tags, data structures, data cleaning, bs4 and overall improved my programming skills.
